## Why MIT?

`teoslinker-bot` is the open distribution layer of the TEOS ecosystem. We want developers, communities, and Pi Network builders to freely fork, extend, and deploy their own Telegram bots powered by the TeosMcp API. The only requirement is keeping this copyright notice intact.

The commercial core of this system — the security analysis engine — lives in [agent-code-risk-mcp](https://github.com/Elmahrosa/agent-code-risk-mcp), which is licensed separately under the Business Source License 1.1.
